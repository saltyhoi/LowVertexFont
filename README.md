# LowVertexFont
This GitHub repository contains Mathematica code for the generation of polygonal shapes representing letters of the alphabet. These polygons are derived from low-resolution rasterized fonts, where simple outlines are extracted from the pixelated letters. The resulting data is organized into three directories: whitebackground, nobackground, svgs.
